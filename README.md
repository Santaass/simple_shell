Shell is a program that takes the command inputs written from the the user’s keyboard and passes them to the machine to execute them through the kernel. Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX Africa Software Engineering.

It also verifies if the command inputs from the user are correct.

he first step is to create an infinite loop that is always ready to take any command and prints the shell’s symbol –in the example above, the “~$”–. In this way we are setting a shell in an interactive mode. The non-interactive way is, for example, when you type echo "/home/user/my_shell" | cd .
